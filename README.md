# Unexpected Output from Julia Function

This repository demonstrates a simple Julia function that produces unexpected output for certain input values.  The `my_function` is intended to return the square of the input if it's greater than 10, and otherwise return the input plus 1. However, there is a subtle issue resulting in incorrect results.

The `bug.jl` file contains the buggy code. The solution is presented in `bugSolution.jl`.
